          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and
              pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of
              water or milk for a fluffier texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and
              add butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in
              the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges
              but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen
              fillings over one half of the omelette.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift
              one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another
              minute, then slide it onto a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
